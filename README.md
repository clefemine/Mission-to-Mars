# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Summary

Create a central location for high resolution images of Mars with Mars facts and an image of the latest article posted of Mars from Nasa's Mars webpage with their brief summary. This automated web-based platform will scrape images using Splinter and BeautifulSoup to attain high resolution images. The scraped web data is then stored using MongoDB and Flask to display the HTML file. Bootstrap is used to style the web app.
